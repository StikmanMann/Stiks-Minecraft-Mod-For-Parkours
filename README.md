# Stiks-Minecraft-Mod-For-Parkours

Hello everyone, I just wanted to publish this so other people can learn a bit about modding.
This obviously is not the best source for learning since im a "novice" at coding.
And I was very lazy at commenting so it'll propably be hard to understand...
But other than that I hope this helps you in your minecraft bedrock modding!

Also I dont have plans to continue this alot so yeah...

And in retrospective I have few things to change, like mainly the saving feature I coded

Enjoy!
